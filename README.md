# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker


## Description

This app allows the user to use a node terminal to view and manipulate a sql database. The app uses an employee database which records employees, roles, and departments. The user can initialize the app with the npm start command in node. The user is then prompted with inquirer prompts which they can use to manipulate or view the stored data.

## Tasks 

- created a schema.sql and seeds.sql file to create the employees_db and seed it with data.
- created inquirer prompts within the index.js file to allow the user to manipulate and view data.
- The app allows a user to add/view a role, employee, or department. The user can also update an employee's role.
